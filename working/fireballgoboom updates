Fireball macro works however there are a couple updates it could use that I hadn't had a chance to do previously.
Some of which were due to lack of campaign properties or other issues

Feature request:
Add support for spell "protection from fire", allow for other damage types. Probably better to build in a way to make a more general dmg 
reduction to cover other spells that also block dmg similar to protection from Fire.

Add support for dealing with tokens which are encumbered or wearing medium or heavy armor (all of which negate Evasion)
